# Test exercise

## Brief
We would like to build a JS Testing application that is able to test the E2E Journey of a platform.

You can write your tests under `/test-exercise`

Example of the journey that we expect:
- Visit a booking website
- Select 'Manchester' as your location
- Select the interval for the days, for example from tomorrow to the day after
- Search results
- In the next page, click the first result, it will open another page with the details about the selection

## Frameworks choice
You can use multiple frameworks, for example:
- Webdrivero.io - Run `./node_modules/.bin/wdio config` to start the configuration
- Cypress
- Taiko
- Nightwatch

## Usage
To start the application you need to build it first:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

You are free to code and run the application using any IDE/text editor of your choice.
You can search the web for information as you'd do in normal work day or ask your interviewers for help and collaboration.
